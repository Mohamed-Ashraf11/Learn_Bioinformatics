# Learn Bioinformatics (Resources)
Hi There, I always received questions like <b> <i> “Could you please help me to learn Bioinformatics?”  </i> </b> and since this is a general question and you need to specify more which topics you would like to learn so I decided to make this repo and I will update it continuously as I found more resources and materials. I always prefer to point out to English materials as I think they are more professionals and educated but I will mention some materials that I really like in Arabic too. <b> <i> All materials that I mentioned here depends on my personal preferences so it may taste differently to the others </i> </b>.
